<h1 align="center"> Deploy a .NET Web Application on Amazon ECS powered by Graviton2</h1>

This repository contains a sample application code, used in demonstrating the step by step guide to deploy a .NET Application on Amazon ECS powered by Graviton2 based EC2 Instances.

Amazon Elastic Container Service ([Amazon ECS](https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/)) is a fully managed container orchestration service that helps you easily deploy, manage, and scale containerized applications.

[AWS Graviton](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/graviton/) processors are custom built by Amazon Web Services using 64-bit Arm Neoverse cores to deliver the best price performance for your cloud workloads running in Amazon EC2. AWS Graviton2 processors deliver a major leap in performance and capabilities over first-generation AWS Graviton processors.

This guide utilizes [AWS Cloud9](https://aws.amazon.com/cloud9/) - a cloud-based integrated development environment (IDE) that lets you write, run, and debug your code with just a browser. The Cloud9 terminal provides a browser-based shell experience enabling you to install additional software, do a git push, or enter commands.

This guide is split into following sections:

- Create a Cloud9 environment with all the tools and pre-reqs using AWS CloudFormation template, [here](cfn/template.yaml) in the repository
- Create a Docker image and push it to [Amazon ECR](https://aws.amazon.com/ecr/)
- Create an [Amazon ECS Cluster](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/clusters.html)
- Deploy the application to the Amazon ECS Cluster
- Configure Monitoring and logging

For the guide, please follow [here](https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/hands-on/deploy-dotnet-web-app-ecs-graviton/).

## Architecture

![Architecture](docs/arch.png)

The architecture is composed of following building blocks:

- AWS Cloud9 environment facilitating creation of docker image, publication of image to Amazon ECR Repository
- Amazon ECS Cluster with an [Application Load Balancer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/introduction.html) to balance the requests among the tasks launched by Amazon ECS Service
- Database layer, powered by [Amazon Aurora MySQL](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/)
- [Amazon Secrets Manager](https://aws.amazon.com/secrets-manager/) to securely store the database credentials, to be used by the sample application
- [Amazon CloudWatch](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/) to enable logging and monitoring of the sample application deployed in Amazon ECS Cluster.

## Usage

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, be sure that you have a registered AWS Account and logged in with an IAM user with permissions specified in the AdministratorAccess. You can follow the steps illustrated [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/get-set-up-for-amazon-ecs.html).
You're not required to follow steps other than **Sign up for AWS** and **Create an IAM user**.

### Code Usage

This is a sample application, only to be used for demonstration of deploying a .Net application on Graviton2 instances behind Amazon ECS.

The getting started guide instructions will illustrate how to clone this repository into a Cloud9 environment, and create a Docker image, for deployment into ECS.

## Module 1: Setup your environment

### Set up your environment

1. Deploy the latest CloudFormation template by following the link below for your preferred AWS region:

| Region                                | Launch Template                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **US East (N. Virginia)** (us-east-1) | [![Launch the ContainerizeDotNetOnECSGraviton2 Stack with CloudFormation](docs/deploy-to-aws.png)](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-east-1#/stacks/new?stackName=ContainerizeDotNetOnECSGraviton2&templateURL=https://containerize-dotnet-app-on-ecs-graviton2-assets.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/containerize_dotnet_app_ecs_graviton2.yml) |
| **US East (Ohio)** (us-east-2)        | [![Launch the ContainerizeDotNetOnECSGraviton2 Stack with CloudFormation](docs/deploy-to-aws.png)](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-east-2#/stacks/new?stackName=ContainerizeDotNetOnECSGraviton2&templateURL=https://containerize-dotnet-app-on-ecs-graviton2-assets.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/containerize_dotnet_app_ecs_graviton2.yml) |
| **US West (Oregon)** (us-west-2)      | [![Launch the ContainerizeDotNetOnECSGraviton2 Stack with CloudFormation](docs/deploy-to-aws.png)](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-west-2#/stacks/new?stackName=ContainerizeDotNetOnECSGraviton2&templateURL=https://containerize-dotnet-app-on-ecs-graviton2-assets.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/containerize_dotnet_app_ecs_graviton2.yml) |
| **EU (Ireland)** (eu-west-1)          | [![Launch the ContainerizeDotNetOnECSGraviton2 Stack with CloudFormation](docs/deploy-to-aws.png)](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=eu-west-1#/stacks/new?stackName=ContainerizeDotNetOnECSGraviton2&templateURL=https://containerize-dotnet-app-on-ecs-graviton2-assets.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/containerize_dotnet_app_ecs_graviton2.yml) |

This should take you to AWS CloudFormation Service - Create Stack screen.

2. On the Create Stack - Step 1: Specify template screen, confirm that the URL https://containerize-dotnet-app-on-ecs-graviton2-assets.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/containerize_dotnet_app_ecs_graviton2.yml is entered in the Amazon S3 URL field and press Next button.
   ![Create Stack](docs/Step1-2.jpg)

3. On the Step 2 - Specify stack details screen, you can specify the stack name, network configuration, as well as Amazon RDS configuration. All required fields are already pre-filled with the default values You can leave them as default and press Next button.

![Specify Stack Details](docs/Step1-3.jpg)

4. On the Step 3 - Configure stack options screen - leave the defaults, and don’t make any changes, just press Next button.

5. On the Step 4 - Review screen, scroll to the bottom of the page and check all checkboxes, as per the screenshot below, then press Create stack for the template to be deployed.
   ![Confirm Stack](docs/Step1-5.jpg)

6. When the template is in the CREATE_COMPLETE you can find information about created environment by going to AWS Console -> CloudFormation, selecting the created stack and going to the Outputs tab. You will see information like on the screenshot below.
   ![Stack Status](docs/Step1-6.jpg)
   Copy the values and paste them into a notepad, or local text file for easy reference in the later instructions.

## Module 2: Setup Cloud9 Workspace

Now that you have configured an AWS Cloud9 environment into your account, you will setup your Cloud9 workspace and download the sample application’s source code into your environment.

### Open your Cloud9 IDE

1. You can launch and navigate to your Cloud9 workspace by clicking on Cloud9 IDE URL shown in your CloudFormation stack outputs.
   ![Stack Outputs](docs/Step2-1.jpg)
   Then you should have an IDE environment as shown below:
   ![Cloud9 Screen](docs/Step2-2.jpg)

1. In Cloud9 open a new **Terminal** window using Top Navigation Window Menu, select New Terminal, it should open a new Terminal window. Keep your AWS Cloud9 IDE opened in a tab as you’ll be using it for future steps.

### Expand Cloud9 Storage

In order to accommodate dependencies, the underlying drive has already been expanded and you only need to increase the partition size. So on the terminal window run following 2 commands:

```
sudo growpart /dev/xvda 1
sudo resize2fs /dev/xvda1
```

### Download Sample Application Code

Download the sample application source code (from this repository) to your AWS Cloud9 IDE environment by running the following command in the Cloud9 terminal window:

`git clone https://github.com/aws-samples/amazon-ecs-dotnet-app-graviton`

## Module 3: Create and Publish Docker Image

In previous modules, you launched an AWS CloudFormation stack, which created a new AWS VPC, Public and Private subnet pairs in 2 Availability Zones, 1 AWS RDS Aurora instance in a Private subnet, and also initialized an AWS Cloud9 environment to issue AWS Command Line Interface(CLI) commands via command line.

You also cloned a sample .NET application from Github on the Cloud9 Bash Terminal, and built a .NET package.
This module gives step by step instructions for the Build and Publish stage of Sample Application.

### Setup Environment Variables

1. Open the AWS Cloud9 new terminal window, following the instruction listed in Module2

2. Configure the AWS CLI with your current region as default (you can retrieve the region you chose from instance metadata)

```
export AWS_REGION=$(curl -s http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/placement/region)
aws configure set default.region ${AWS_REGION}
aws configure get default.region
```

3. Set up env variable for AWS account id, for later reuse

```
export AWS_ACCOUNT_ID=$(aws sts get-caller-identity --query Account --output text)
echo $AWS_ACCOUNT_ID
```

In subsequent steps you will be referring these values, so storing them in the environment variables takes away the need of copy pasting the values, or writing long command line instructions.

### Create ECR Repository

Create an Amazon ECR repository to store movie-app image, and note the Repo URI in the output. The output is also stored in an env variable called IMAGE_REPO_URI, using your utility function save_var. You can choose any name for your repository, in the example here, you chose movie-app-repo.

```
export IMAGE_REPO_URI=$( \
aws ecr create-repository \
--repository-name movie-app-repo \
--query repository.repositoryUri \
--output text \
)
echo Repo URI: $IMAGE_REPO_URI
```

The result should look something like this:

![dotnet-ecs-graviton-module-3-1-create-repo-output](docs/Step3-1.png)

Keep this information on a separate notepad as you'll need this image repository URI when you specify container definition in your Amazon ECS Task Definition.

### Create Docker Image

In this step you'll create a Dockerfile and then build a docker image for your sample application.

1. Move to the source code directory

```
cd ~/environment/amazon-ecs-dotnet-app-graviton/app/
```

2. Create Dockerfile in the root of the project

```
touch Dockerfile
```

3. Open Dockerfile either in Cloud9 IDE or via command-line text editor such as nano or vi, and the commands listed below. Each command has an inline documentation below to explain the purpose of the command.

```
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:5.0 AS build
WORKDIR /src

# These lines copy MvcMovie.csproj project files in the current directory
# and then restore for the specified runtime, using -r.
COPY ["MvcMovie.csproj", "./"]
RUN dotnet restore "MvcMovie.csproj" -r linux-musl-arm64

# Build dotnet project and publishes the application and its dependencies to a folder for deployment to a hosting system.
COPY . .
WORKDIR "/src/."
RUN dotnet publish "MvcMovie.csproj" -c Release -o /app/publish -r linux-musl-arm64 --self-contained false --no-restore


# Docker build command
# You need to use an architecture-specific tag if you want to target ARM based instances.
# Note that .NET is only supported on Alpine on ARM64 and x64, and not ARM32.
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet:5.0-alpine-arm64v8
WORKDIR /app
EXPOSE 80
COPY --from=build /app/publish .
ENTRYPOINT ["dotnet", "MvcMovie.dll"]
```

4. Build and publish docker image with tag movie-app. Tag your image with the Amazon ECR registry, repository, and optional image tag name combination to use. For detail you can refer here later. The commands below can take a few minutes.

```
docker build -t movie-app .
docker tag movie-app $IMAGE_REPO_URI
```

5.  Confirm the image is created successfully

```
docker images movie-app
```

The command line outputs should look something like below:
![Docker Images](docs/Step3-3.png)

### Publish Docker Image

In this step you'll login to your Amazon ECR Repository, and then publish the new image you built in the last step.

1. To be able to push the image to the Amazon ECR, you'll login into the default private Amazon Elastic Container Registry. The URL for your default private registry (replacing the values from environment variables you created earlier) is: https://$AWS_ACCOUNT_ID.dkr.ecr.$AWS_REGION.amazonaws.com

```
aws ecr get-login-password | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin $AWS_ACCOUNT_ID.dkr.ecr.$AWS_REGION.amazonaws.com
```

2. Finally you’ll push the docker container you created to the repository, via following command.

```
docker push $IMAGE_REPO_URI
aws ecr describe-images --repository-name movie-app-repo
```

Output should look like this
![ECR Docker Image](docs/Step3-4.png)

## Module 4: Create Amazon ECS Cluster

In previous modules, you created a Graviton2 Build Platform, created and published a Docker container into an Amazon ECR Repository. In this module, you'll deploy the newly published container into Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS).

### Enable new ECS Experience

From the AWS Management Console go to Amazon Elastic Container Service, either via search function or from the Services drop down button, and looking under the category - Containers.

The screenshots in this section may look different for those using old ECS Experience, ensure that where applicable, in left hand navigation pane New ECS Experience is enabled. If navigation pane is not visible, for some services, it may require clicking the hamburger button, to expand the navigation pane.

![New Experience](docs/Step4-1.png)

### Create ECS Cluster

In this step you'll create a new ECS Cluster.

1. Click on Clusters menu in the navigation pane, and click on Create Cluster button.

2. In **Step 1: Select cluster template**, choose **EC2 Linux + Networking.....** option and click **Next step** button
   ![Create Cluster](docs/Step4-2.png)

3. In **Step 2 : Configure cluster**, use following values for the specified labels, and leave the rest default.

**Cluster name**: Graviton2ECSCluster

**EC2 Instance type**: t4g.medium

**Number of instances**: 1

![Configure Cluster](docs/Step4-3.jpg)

4. In the **Networking** section, enter following values for the specified labels:

**VPC**: select **TargetVPC** from the dropdown

**Subnets**: select 2 private subnets **TargetVPC-private-a-web** and **TargetVPC-private-b-web**, one after another

**Security Group**: select **ECSServiceSG** from the dropdown. You can click on the Security group selected to see the inbound and outbound rules.

![ECS Networking](docs/Step4-4.png)

5. Leave rest of the settings as default, which means:

- **Container instance IAM role**: a new IAM role will be created which allows the instances provisioned to be able to access other AWS services.

- Ensure the **Enable Container Insights** Checkbox is ticked.

![Container Insights](docs/Step4-5.png)

6. Now click **Create** button, on the next screen it should show you the progress of the cluster being created. Once successful, click **View Cluster** to see the details.

![Cluster](docs/Step4-6.png)

At this stage, you have an ECS Cluster created, with private subnets, however you don’t have any service/tasks running. For that you need to create a [Task Definition](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task_definitions.html).

### Create ECS Task Definition

1. Under the left hand side navigation pane on Amazon ECS page, you'll find an option for Task Definitions, click **Create new Task Definition**. This is the stage where you will specify the details of the container to be deployed, CPU and memory requirements, for simplicity, you will keep the changes to minimum. So leave the options default, unless specified.

2. In **Step 1: Select launch type compatibility**, Select EC2 for Launch type compatibility, hit **Next step**

![New task Definition](docs/Step4-7.png)

3. In Step 2: Configure task and container definitions, enter following values for the specified labels:

- **Task Definition Name**: Graviton2ECSTask
- **Task Role**: None
- **Task execution IAM role**: choose the role available in the dropdown - -ECSTaskExecutionRole. If you used the name suggested in Module 2 above, it should start with ContainerizeDotNetOnECSGraviton2-ECSTaskExecutionRole, this allows tasks to pull container images and publish container logs to Amazon CloudWatch on your behalf, as well as enables it to read secrets from AWS Secrets manager.
- **Task memory (MiB)**: 512
- **Task CPU (unit)**: 1024

It should look like below

![Confirm Task Definition](docs/Step4-8.png)

4. Next step is to define the container to be used, click **Add Container** under **Container Definitions**, it should open a new window, then enter following values for the specified labels:

- **Container name**: Graviton2Container
- **Image**: paste the IMAGE_REPO_URI, that you copied earlier from Cloud9 console, make sure it ends with the tag: latest, unless you used a specific tag. It should be <AWS_ACCOUNT_ID>.dkr.ecr.<AWS_REGION>.amazonaws.com/movie-app-repo:latest
- **Port mapping**: 0, 80 i.e. container to make port accessible for the underlying host port 80. Note: When you omit the Host Port (or set it to 0) while specifying a Container Port and your container automatically receives a port in the ephemeral port range for your container instance operating system and Docker version.

![Container Definition](docs/Step4-9.jpg)

5. Next you have to add environment variables for the container to be able to access the Database instance deployed by the CloudFormation template in Module 1.

Also refer the value of the key **RDSSecretARN**, you copy pasted for later reference in the Module 2. you'll need it now.

In the **Environment Section** section under **Environment variables**, Add following environment variables.

Note: Where applicable values end with double colon symbols (::).

| Key       | Value/valueFrom | value                                                   |
| --------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| DBHOST    | ValueFrom       | `<RDSSecretARN from CloudFormation Outputs>:host::`     |
| DBNAME    | ValueFrom       | `<RDSSecretARN from CloudFormation Outputs>:dbname::`   |
| DBUSER    | ValueFrom       | `<RDSSecretARN from CloudFormation Outputs>:username::` |
| DBPASS    | ValueFrom       | `<RDSSecretARN from CloudFormation Outputs>:password::` |
| DBSSLMODE | Value           | `none`                                                  |

- **Key**: name of the env variable for your application, e.g. DBHOST
- **Value/ValueFrom** dropdown value: value for hard coded values, and ValueFrom for the values retrieved from AWS Systems manager Parameter Store/AWS Secrets Manager.
- **Value**: This guide demonstrates using AWS Secrets manager to store database credentials securely, so the value will be in the format as `arn:aws:secretsmanager:region:<aws_account_id>:secret:secret-name:json-key:version-stage:version-id` specified by the ECS documentation [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/specifying-sensitive-data-secrets.html).

![Container Environment Variables](docs/Step4-10.png)

6. Under **STORAGE AND LOGGING** section select checkbox for **Log Configuration - Auto-configure CloudWatch Logs**, as below:

![Container Logging](docs/Step4-11.jpg)
Leave rest of the settings as is and press Add button at the bottom of the screen.

7. Back on the Task Definitions page, you should see the container definition, just created. Hit Create button to create the Task definition.

![Task Definition Created](docs/Step4-12.png)

8. Click on **Clusters** in the left side navigation pane, and then click on **Graviton2ECSCluster** from the list of Clusters.

![Cluster launched](docs/Step4-13.png)

Review the Service and Tasks and you’ll see no records. This means that although your Task Definition is complete but no Tasks are running, so in the next section you'll create Amazon ECS Service, which will launch a [Load balanced Amazon ECS Service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/userguide/service-load-balancing.html) and runs tasks using the task definition you created in this module.

## Module 5: Deploy the Application to Amazon ECS

So far in the guide you have prepared the foundational environment for your sample application in Module 1 and Module 2. In Module 3 you built and published the Docker image for the sample application, and in Module 4 you created the building blocks required to launch a Load Balanced [Amazon ECS Service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs_services.html) that will instantiate tasks behind the AWS Application Load Balancer.

### Create ECS Service

1. Select the Cluster - **Graviton2ECSCluster**

![Cluster - Deploy Service](docs/Step5-1.png)

2. Under the Services Tab, click Deploy button

3. Under the Environment Section, expand Compute Configuration (advanced) section

4. Select the Cluster you created (should already be selected) i.e. Graviton2ECS

5. Select Launch Type as EC2 from the dropdown

![Service Launch Type](docs/Step5-2.png)

6. Under Deployment configuration section select Service, and under Task definition - Family select the task you created - **Graviton2ECSTask**, and **Revision** as **LATEST**

7. Enter **name** as **Graviton2ECSService**

8. Enter value for **Desired Tasks** to be **2**, as shown in the screenshot below

![Desired Tasks](docs/Step5-3.png)

Stay on the same screen, you'll setup Load Balancing for the Service.

### Setup Load Balancing

1. Expand Load balancing - optional section, select Create a new load balancer and enter name as **Graviton2ECSALB**

2. Ensure Listener Port is 80 and Protocol HTTP

3. Enter Target group name as **Graviton2ECS-ALB-TG** and protocol as HTTP

![ALB Configuration](docs/Step5-4.png)

### Define Network Boundaries

1. In the Networking section select **TargetVPC** under the VPC dropdown.

2. Select Public subnets - **TargetVPC-public-a** and **TargetVPC-public-b**, this is only required for ALB Configuration.

3. Under Security group select - **Use an existing security group** and choose **ALBSG** from the dropdown.

![Networking](docs/Step5-5.png)

4. Leave rest of the settings to default.

5. Click **Deploy** button. Service deployment can take a few minutes. Once finished the Cluster will look like.

![Cluster with Service](docs/Step5-6.png)

6. Click on Service **Graviton2ECSService** from the list of Services to view the Tasks running, Health check status and notifications:

![Service](docs/Step5-7.png)

You can note the Desired and Running count to verify that that ECS Service has successfully instantiated desired number of tasks. At this stage your Sample Application is live, under a single Task, behind an Application Load Balancer.

### Enable Session Management for Sample Application

Sample .Net web application has Login Functionality, which enables logged in user to edit the records, stored in Aurora DB.

For the session management, this guide takes the simplest route by enabling sticky session, instead of adding complexity in the .Net sample app.

Sticky sessions are a mechanism to route requests from the same client to the same target. Elastic Load Balancers support sticky sessions. Stickiness is defined at a target group level.

So the next step is to modify the Load balancing target group created by the ECS Service - **Graviton2ECS-ALB-TG**, and enable Session stickiness.

1. Go to EC2 from the Services drop down in the top navigation or search for EC2, click on Target Groups from Load Balancing category in the left hand side navigation pane.

2. Choose the name of **Graviton2ECS-ALB-TG** target group to open its details page.

3. On the Group details tab, in the Attributes section, choose Edit.

![Enable Sticky Session](docs/Step5-8.jpg)
On the Edit attributes page,

4. Select Stickiness.

5. For Stickiness type, select Load balancer generated cookie.

6. For Stickiness duration, leave the default value of 1 day.

7. Choose Save changes.

![Enable Sticky Session 2](docs/Step5-9.jpg)

### Test the deployment

Now the application is ready for testing, and you need to find the public facing URL of the application, which is the DNS Name of the Application Load Balancer created by ECS Service.

1. Staying on EC2 Service console, click on Load Balancers in the left side Navigation pane, and select **Graviton2ECSALB**.

2. Copy the value of DNS Name as shown below:

![ALB URL Page](docs/Step5-10.png)

3. Open the copied URL in a new Browser window, It should open the Sample Application - Academy Award website.

![Website](docs/Step5-11.png)

Application is in read-only for anonymous users, to be able to modify the data, you can login to the application using following admin credentials:

```
Username: admin
Password: Pass@word1
```

When you logged in for the first time, application asks you to set a new password for your user, choose a new password and continue.

This step completes the deployment of Sample .NET Web Application on Amazon ECS.

## Module 6: Monitoring and Logging

This final module will focus on how you enable monitoring for your ECS environment using Amazon CloudWatch [Container Insights](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/ContainerInsights.html).

This can be used to collect, aggregate, and summarise metrics and logs from your containerised application.

Container Insights also provides diagnostic information, such as container restart failures, to help you isolate issues and resolve them quickly. You can also set CloudWatch alarms on metrics that Container Insights collects.

### Confirm Container Insights is Enabled

1. If for any reason, you missed to enable Container Insights in Module 4, you can enable it via AWS CLI on existing Amazon ECS clusters run the command below:

```
aws ecs update-cluster-settings --cluster Graviton2ECSCluster --settings name=containerInsights,value=enabled --region ${AWS_REGION}
```

2. From the response of the command confirm that the settings the name “containerInsights” has the value “enabled”

### Visualising Container Insights in CloudWatch

1. Navigate to the [Amazon CloudWatch Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch) by typing “CloudWatch” and selecting the service name from the drop down
2. The CloudWatch console is displayed as show below, ensure the **New menu experience** is selected on the top left corner of the screen to use the new CloudWatch console. On the menu on the left, click on **Container Insights** under the **Insights** section.

![Container Insights - 1](docs/Step6-3.png)

3. The Container Insights dashboard is show below, ensure the **List View** is selected at the top right corner to show the list of the container resources. You can see the **Graviton2ECSCluster**, **Graviton2ECSService** and **Graviton2ECSTask**, which are resources created so far.

![Container Insights - 2](docs/Step6-4.png)

4. Container Insights provides metrics for each of these resources to help provide visibility on what is going on within the resources. Click on each of the resource to see the metrics as show below

   **Cluster metrics** - this provides a view of the CPU Utilisation, Memory Utilisation and Network Transferred and Received. It also provides a view of the count of Container Instance, Task and Service within the cluster.

   ![Cluster Metrics](docs/Step6-5.png)

   **Service metrics** - provides a view of the aggregated metrics of the tasks running within the service and also the performance for each of the tasks.

   **Task metrics** - provides a view of the metrics for each task running in the cluster.

### Analysing Application Logs via CloudWatch

While creating the Task Definition as shown in Module 4, you enabled Log Configuration and specified a name for the log group. This will enable the application logs that were previously sent out to standard output to be sent to Amazon CloudWatch Logs. In this step, you will see how to review the application logs sent to CloudWatch.

1. Navigate to the CloudWatch Console and click on Log Group under Logs in the left menu

![CloudWatch Logs 1](docs/Step6-7.png)

2. The Log Group that was configured in Module 4 while creating the task definition is **/ecs/Graviton2ECSTask**. Select this log group to show the log streams from the containers in the ECS task. Sending logs to Cloudwatch logs enables you to view different logs from your containers in one convenient location, and it prevents your container logs from taking up disk space on your container instances.

3. Select a log stream to display the application logs. On the top right corner of the screen you can specify filters based on date and time to retrieve the logs.
